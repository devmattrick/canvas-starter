# canvas-starter
This is a simple project that is meant to be a simple starting point for basic
canvas websites. I am mostly using it for my own personal projects, but it may
be useful to you if:

* You only intend to have one page (index.html)
* You like TypeScript
* You want something as simple as possible
* You want to get started quickly

## Contributing
Contributions are always welcome, however please try to keep the general scope
of this project small (for example, don't include a canvas library like Phaser).
This is meant to be a simple base to build off of and as such is library/
framework/ etc. agnostic.
